# Udacity Machine Learning Nano Degree - Capstone

## Udacity+Arvato: Identify Customer Segments

### Installation
This Jupyter notebook has been tested with python 3.8 and requires the libraries
stated under the requirements file.
The main notebook is: **ProjectWorkbook.ipynb**

### Description
The company Arvato Financial Services, a Bertelsmann subsidiary, connected
with Udacity to propose a capstone project, as one of the options for the
Data Science and Machine Learning Nanodegrees.
They provided different datasets that will be discussed in the following sections,
that consist of a mail-order sales company in Gernmany that is interested in
identifying segments of the general population to target with their marketing
in order to grow. This kind of practices is pursued by different companies in
order to help them improve their ROI, by addressing to customers who are likely
to buy certain product, churn or default on a loan. (Sebastiaan Höppner, 2017)
For this project I will be addressing the mail-order sales data, among other
datasets, in order to apply machine learning techniques to provide an estimator
that may infer which individuals are most likely to respond to their marketing
campaign and become customers of the mail-order company.

### Project Statement
There are two main goals that the Arvato Financial Services wants to address
using the datasets provided. First, to analyze attributes of established
customers and the general population in order to create customer segments.
Second, to use previous analysis to build a model using machine learning
techniques in order to infer whether an individual will respond to one of
their marketing campaigns, or not.


### Acknowledgement
In order to reproduce my solution and results, all development Python code is
available in this Github repository. It is important to remark that in addition
to Udacity’s Terms of Use and other policies, the datasets for this project are
